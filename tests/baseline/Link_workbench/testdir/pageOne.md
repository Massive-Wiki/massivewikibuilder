## Links for backlinks

Here's a page that has some links.

We have a [[Massive Wiki Roadmap]].

We have [[links that are incipient]] (i.e., a link to MassiveWiki page that has not yet been created).

You can make a link like this: `[[double square brackets]]` - for example, `[[Massive Wiki Roadmap]]`.

Sometimes, we use a fenced code block as an example.

```markdown
# H1
## H2

- bullet 1
- bullet 2

Wikilinks: [[double square brackets]], for example, [[Massive Wiki Roadmap]]
```

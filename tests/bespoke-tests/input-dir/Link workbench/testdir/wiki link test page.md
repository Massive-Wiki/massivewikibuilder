# wiki link test page
### 2022-04-23
Here we are providing samples for fuzzy linking to other pages:

  - one at the root [[The Walrus]]
  - one in this folder [[sameFolder note]]
  - one in a folder in a folder [[folder in a folder test page]]
  - let's include an image [[2021-11-11-Milosz.jpeg| of a poem]]

Another set of links with explicit paths to wiki pages for testing:
 (N.B. Obsidian behavior when trying to create these pages by double-clicking in read-view: Obsidian does not create a new page even when subdir exists (it is more complicated than that))
 
- [[wiki page1]]
- [[../wiki page2]]
- [[../../wiki page3]]
- [[../subdir/wiki page4]]
- [[/wiki page5]]
- [[/subdir2/wiki page6]]
- [[text only wiki page.txt]]
- [[is this? wiki page7]]
- [[the special??wiki page8]]
- [[Link workbench/octothorpe #wiki page]]
- [[Link workbench/what   about? #??____this ##page]]
- [[/subdir2/this. directory. contains./wiki page8]]
- [[Filename, with a comma]]
- [[This filename has "double" quotes]]
